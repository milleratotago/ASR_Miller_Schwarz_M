# ASR_Miller_Schwarz_M
MATLAB software for analysis of the ASR model.

## Demos

* Demo1: Fit ex-Gaussian version of ASR model.
* Demo2: Compute predictions of ASR model for versions of the model with various distributions of process finishing times (i.e., not just exponential and normal).
* Demo3: Another example of fitting the ex-Gaussian version of the ASR model, this time with Cupid routines.
* Demo4: An example of fitting a non-exGaussian version of the ASR model.  (WARNING: TAKES SEVERAL MINUTES)
* Demo5: An example of fitting the exGaussian version of the ASR model to correct & error RTs.  (WARNING: TAKES SEVERAL MINUTES)

NOTE: Demo2-Demo5 use the "Cupid" probability distribution objects available from https://github.com/milleratotago/Cupid. You must install Cupid before you can try any of these demos.
