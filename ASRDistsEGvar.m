    % Create predicted RTcon & RTinc distributions for ASR model with exponential
    %   finishing times for processes A & B and Gaussian finishing times for process C.
    % ALL TIMES MUST BE IN THE SAME UNITS (E.G., MILLISECONDS).
    %
    % INPUT PARAMETERS:
    %
    % TauA: mean finishing time for activation suppression process
    %
    % TauB: mean finishing time for relevant info extraction process
    %
    % MuC & SigmaC: mean & std deviation of stage C finishing times
    %   without influence from irrelevant activation
    %
    % LambdaExc: Change in mean stage C finishing times with excitation in
    %   congruent trials (i.e., irrelevant activation has not been suppressed).
    %   NEGATIVE NUMBER INDICATES SPEEDUP
    %
    % SigmaCExc: Stage C finishing time sigma with excitation in congruent trials
    %   (i.e., irrelevant activation has not been suppressed).
    %
    % LambdaInh: Change in mean stage C finishing times with inhibition in
    %   incongruent trials (i.e., irrelevant activation has not been suppressed).
    %   POSITIVE NUMBER INDICATES SLOWDOWN
    %
    % SigmaCInh: Stage C finishing time sigma with inhibition in incongruent trials
    %   (i.e., irrelevant activation has not been suppressed).
    %
    % SOA: time from the start of process A to the start of process B
    %   (0 if they start simultaneously).
    %
    % OUTPUTS:
    %
    % RTcon: Distribution of RTs in congruent trials.
    %
    % RTinc: Distribution of RTs in incongruent trials.
    %
    % PrBwins: Probability that B wins the A/B race so that stage C is affected by excitation or inhibition.
    
    % Time 0 is the onset of A at the beginning of this function.
    % Time 0 will be changed to the onset of B at the end.
